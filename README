A 'personal' fun project to let one plan 'events' on a map.
Events can be filled in as you like. 
One can plan a parties, and use this tool to publish the locations and the date of the parties as well as to keep track of the organisation 'todo' list of the party planning.
Another may use this to track issues in the public space and keep track of the communications and issue-statusses.
